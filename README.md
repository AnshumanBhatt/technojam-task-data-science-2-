# technojam-task-data-science-2-
Q)HOW DID I APPROACH THE TASK??
      When i looked at the task i knew that i have to either go for python or r i didn't knew both.
      i looked at the tutorilas in the youtube with the limited time and tried to complete it but i faced many problems including syntax errors and many more
 
Q)CHALLANGES FACED
     the biggest chalenge i faced was that i lacked the knowledge of python i didn't knew python at all before this but now i know some of the basics includin how to add csv file 
     and how to add libraries
